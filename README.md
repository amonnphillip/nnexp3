neural network experiment 3, convolution neural networks and hand drawn number recognition

This is my attempt to understand the convolution (pool and relu) layer of a neural network. This experiment uses the MNIST data set of hand drawn numeric characters to train a neural network to recognize numeric characters.

Run the demo, the network will train, then test again randonly selected images from the MNIST test set. You should see results of around 83% to 90% correct recognition.

To run you need to have nodejs installed (v4.2.4 +). From the command line type node index.js
